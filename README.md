  React
</h2>

<p>
  React is used for the project because it provides a robust and efficient way to build complex user interfaces with reusable components. 
  Its virtual DOM system and efficient rendering make it ideal for large-scale applications, 
  and its extensive ecosystem of libraries and tools allows for easy integration with other technologies.
